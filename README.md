# monitor-input-controller
For controlling monitor inputs via PowerShell

Uses NirSoft's [ControlMyMonitor](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/control_my_monitor.html) to change the monitor input via a PowerShell function rather than manually changing the input source on the monitor. This is helpful when you have more than one monitor and need to switch between inputs frequently.
